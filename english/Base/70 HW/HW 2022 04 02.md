# Travel

Travel - is one of the best practices for people. 
When you travel you explore new unique places and receive experiences.
Travel - is learning a new language if you travel in a different country, meet new friends and try local dishes.
For me travel is a mix of nature, cities and people.
The optimum length of travel for me should be two weeks because you do not need to hurry and do not get tired. 
Before traveling, I usually prepare a short list of destinations which I want to see. 
Sometimes I tune the travel for visit some music events or forums.
After arriving in a new place, first two or three days I just walk a lot or ride a bicycle and look around without a goal and map. 
I like to find randomly interesting places and viewpoints. 
After that I prefer to visit key points from my list (events, zoo and parks, oldest and modern museums, and look at some historical buildings).
At the event I can get acquainted with new people, and continue to travel with them.
In the second week I prefer to go out of the city to explore nature. To hike on some beautiful tracks, look at the forest, lakes, rivers and listen to audiobooks or talks if I travel not alone.
In the last days i return to city and visit shops and local markets to buy some presents.
