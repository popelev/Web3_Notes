# The New Year. 

The main celebration in my country is The New Year. 
Vast majority of people wait this day for a whole year. 
Children wait this day, because they will receive presents, which they asked in the letter to Ded Moroz (Santa in Russia).
Adults - because it is official day off for two weeks.
In this time you can spend time with your family and visit your parents, if they live in a different city.
We prepare and give funny presents to each other.
We wish for friends a good health, happiness and money.
Together we cook a lot of dishes (salads and second courses).
At 11:00 p.m. we start see off The Old Year and at 00:00 a.m. we say welcome for New Year and drink a glass of champagne.
After that we go outside on main square of city and look on fireworks.
After that we visit friends and celebrate with them.
  
Usually I celebrate The New Year with my parents and on next days with my friend.
We rent a house for few days in beautiful place in the forest. Where we can walk around and listen to silence of nature.
We play in Secret Santa and try to guess who prepared presents for us.
When we start celebrate with friends we say thanks to Old year one by one and say why.
After that we joke, play board games and watch films.
In next day we ride snowmobiles (look like jet ski) and go to look the nature.
After return from ride, we grill BBQ and continue to celebrate.
